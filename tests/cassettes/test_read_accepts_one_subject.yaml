        The switch of mitochondrial respiration to fermentation as the main pathway\
        \ to produce ATP through the increase of glycolytic flux is known as the Crabtree\
        \ effect. The elucidation of the molecular mechanism of the Crabtree effect\
        \ may have important applications in ethanol production and lay the groundwork\
        \ for the Warburg effect, which is essential in the molecular etiology of\
        \ cancer. A key piece in this mechanism could be Snf1p, which is a protein\
        \ that participates in the nutritional response that includes glucose metabolism.\
        \ Thus, this work aimed to recognize the role of the SNF1 complex on the glycolytic\
        \ flux and mitochondrial respiration, to gain insights about its relationship\
        \ with the Crabtree effect. Herein, we found that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae\
        \ cells grown at 1% glucose, mutation of SNF1 gene decreased glycolytic flux,\
        \ increased NAD(P)H, enhanced HXK2 gene transcription, and decreased mitochondrial\
        \ respiration. Meanwhile, the same mutation increased the mitochondrial respiration\
        \ of cells grown at 10% glucose. Moreover, SNF4 gene deletion increased respiration\
        \ and growth at 1% of glucose. In the case of the GAL83 gene, we did not detect\
        \ any change in mitochondrial respiration or growth. Altogether, these findings\
        \ indicate that SNF1 is vital to switch from mitochondrial respiration to\
        \ fermentation.\n]]></description>\n<dc:creator>Martinez-Ortiz, C.</dc:creator>\n\

        </link>\n<description><![CDATA[\nThe importance of genome replication has\
        \ inspired detailed crystallographic studies of enzymatic DNA/RNA polymerization.\
        \ In contrast, the mechanism of nonenzymatic polymerization is less well understood,\
        \ despite its critical role in the origin of life. Here we report the direct\
        \ observation of nonenzymatic RNA primer extension through time-resolved crystallography.\
        \ We soaked crystals of an RNA primer-template-dGMP complex with guanosine-5'-phosphoro-2-aminoimidazolide\
        \ for increasing times. At early times we see the activated ribonucleotides\
        \ bound to the template, followed by formation of the imidazolium-bridged\
        \ dinucleotide intermediate. At later times, we see a new phosphodiester bond\
        \ forming between the primer and the incoming nucleotide. The intermediate\
        \ is pre-organized because of the constraints of base-pairing with the template\
        \ and hydrogen bonding between the imidazole amino group and both flanking\
        \ phosphates. Our results provide atomic-resolution insight into the mechanism\
        \ of nonenzymatic primer extension, and set the stage for further structural\
        \ dissection and optimization of the RNA copying process.\n]]></description>\n\

        <link>\nhttp://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/286237v1?rss=1\n</link>\n<description><![CDATA[\n\
        Objective: To evaluate a novel approach to measure beta-cell function by frequent\
        \ testing of C-peptide concentrations in dried blood spots (DBS). Patients:\
        \ Thirty-two children, aged 7-17 years, recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes.\
        \ Design: Mixed-meal-tolerance-test (MMTT) within 6 and again 12 months after\
        \ diagnosis with paired venous and DBS C-peptide sampling at 0 and 90 minutes.\
        \ Weekly DBS C-peptide before and after standardized breakfasts collected\
        \ at home. Results: DBS and plasma C-peptide levels (n=115) correlated strongly\
        \ (r=0.91; p<0.001). The Bland-Altman plot indicated good agreement. The median\
        \ number of home-collected DBS cards per participant was 24 over a median\
        \ of 6.9 months. Repeated DBS C-peptide levels varied considerably within\
        \ and between subjects. Adjustment for corresponding home glucose measurements\
        \ reduced the variance permitting accurate description of changes over time.\
        \ The correlation of the C-peptide slope over time assessed by repeated home\
        \ DBS versus area under the curve during the two MMTTs was r=0.73; p<0.001.\
        \ Mixed models showed that a 1-month increase of diabetes duration was associated\
        \ with 17 pmol/l decline in fasting DBS C-peptide, whereas increases of 1\
        \ mmol/l in glucose, 1 year older age-at-diagnosis and 100 pmol/l higher baseline\
        \ plasma C-peptide were associated with 18, 17 and 61 pmol/l higher fasting\
        \ DBS C-peptide levels, respectively. In addition, glucose responsiveness\
        \ decreased with longer diabetes duration. Conclusion: Our approach permitted\
        \ frequent assessment of C-peptide, making it feasible to monitor beta-cell\
        \ function at home. Evaluation of changes in the slope of C-peptide using\
        \ this method may permit short-term evaluation of promising interventions.\n\

        Protein trafficking in the endosomal system involves the recognition of specific\
        \ signals within the cytoplasmic domains (CDs) of transmembrane proteins by\
        \ clathrin adaptors. One such signal is the phosphoserine acidic cluster (PSAC),\
        \ the prototype of which is in the endoprotease Furin. How PSACs are recognized\
        \ by clathrin adaptors has been controversial. We reported previously that\
        \ HIV-1 Vpu, which modulates cellular immunoreceptors, contains a PSAC that\
        \ binds to the  subunits of clathrin adaptor protein (AP) complexes. Here,\
        \ we show that the CD of Furin binds the  subunits of AP-1 and AP-2 in a phosphorylation-dependent\
        \ manner. Moreover, we identify a PSAC in a cytoplasmic loop of the cellular\
        \ transmembrane Serinc3, an inhibitor of the infectivity of retroviruses.\
        \ The two serines within the PSAC of Serinc3 are phosphorylated by casein\
        \ kinase II and mediate interaction with the  subunits in vitro. The sites\
        \ of these serines vary among mammals in a manner consistent with host-pathogen\
        \ conflict, yet the Serinc3-PSAC seems dispensible for anti-HIV activity and\
        \ for counteraction by HIV-1 Nef. The CDs of Vpu, Furin, and the PSAC-containing\
        \ loop of Serinc3 each bind the  subunit of AP-2 () with similar affinities,\
        \ but they appear to utilize different basic regions on . The Serinc3 loop\
        \ requires a region previously reported to bind the acidic plasma membrane\
        \ lipid phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate. These data suggest that the\
        \ PSACs within different proteins recognize different basic regions on the\
        \  surface, providing the potential to inhibit the activity of viral proteins\
        \ without necessarily affecting cellular protein trafficking.\n]]></description>\n\

        \ regime to attenuate cod-bone soup bitterness: comparison with a rainbow\
        \ trout extract-mediated bitter taste masking approach \n]]>\n</title>\n<link>\n\
        http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/279265v1?rss=1\n</link>\n<description><![CDATA[\n\
        BACKGROUND: The fresh bones (with some meat on them; frequently discarded\
        \ as a large quantity of industry garbage) of marine fish such as cod and\
        \ salmon are good materials for manufacture of food additives (taste adjusters).\
        \ However, such fish-bone originated additives often have apparent bitter\
        \ taste and need additional debittering regime. RESULTS: In this study, 46\
        \ known bitter peptides in the cod proteome were targeted for specific protease\
        \ digestion to eliminate bitter taste from the cod bone soup. Though the debittering\
        \ effect was apparent, the bitter taste was not completely removed. However,\
        \ the bitter taste can be removed by addition of trout extract to a complete\
        \ extent. The strong debittering power of rainbow trout extract was further\
        \ confirmed by the debittering experiments on salmon bone soup and bitter\
        \ melon, both with perfect results. CONCLUSION: These results indicated that\
        \ the cod bone soup bitterness comes not only from bitter peptide but also\
        \ from other substances that can be masked by trout extract. Considering the\
        \ fact that trout proteome has more potential bitter peptides than cod, trout\
        \ extract shall have a strong bitter masking substance to be determined in\
        \ the future.\n]]></description>\n<dc:creator>Han, Y.</dc:creator>\n<dc:creator>Guo,\

        \ inhibition by cellular factors are largely understood in the context of\
        \ molecular chaperones. As an alternative and complementary model, we previously\
        \ proposed that, in general, soluble cellular macromolecules including chaperones\
        \ with large excluded volume and surface charges exhibit the intrinsic chaperone\
        \ activity to prevent aggregation of their connected polypeptides, irrespective\
        \ of the connection types, and thus to aid productive protein folding. As\
        \ a proof of concept, we here demonstrated that a model soluble protein with\
        \ an inactive protease domain robustly exerted chaperone activity toward various\
        \ proteins harboring a short protease-recognition tag of 7 residues in Escherichia\
        \ coli. The chaperone activity of this protein was similar or even superior\
        \ to that of representative E. coli chaperones in vivo. Furthermore, in vitro\
        \ refolding experiments confirmed the in vivo results. Our findings revealed\
        \ that a soluble protein exhibits the intrinsic chaperone activity, which\
        \ is manifested, upon binding to aggregation-prone proteins. This study gives\

        The coupled transport of ions and substrates allows transporters to accumulate\
        \ substrates using the energy in transmembrane ion gradients and electrical\
        \ potentials. During transport, conformational changes that switch accessibility\
        \ of substrate and ion binding sites from one side of the membrane to the\
        \ other must be controlled so as to prevent uncoupled movement of ions or\
        \ substrates. In the Neurotransmitter:Sodium Symporter (NSS) family, Na+ stabilizes\
        \ the transporter in an outward-open state, thus decreasing the likelihood\
        \ of uncoupled Na+ transport. In a step essential for coupled transport, substrate\
        \ binding must overcome the effect of Na+, allowing intracellular substrate\
        \ and Na+ release from an inward-open state. However, it is unclear which\
        \ specific elements of the protein mediate this conformational response to\
        \ substrate binding. Previously, we showed that in the prokaryotic NSS transporter\
        \ LeuT, the effect of Na+ on conformation occurs at the Na2 site, where it\
        \ influences conformation by fostering interaction between two domains of\
        \ the protein (JBC 291: 1456, 2016). Here, we identify a conserved tyrosine\
        \ residue in the substrate binding site required for substrate to enable conversion\
        \ to inward-open states by establishing an interaction between the two transporter\
        \ domains. We further identify additional interactions between the two transporter\
        \ domains in the extracellular pathway that are required. Together with our\
        \ previous work on the conformational effect of Na+, these results identify\
        \ mechanistic components underlying ion-substrate coupling in NSS transporters.\n\

        \ Yet, its application on large and complex multidomain proteins is challenging,\

        BACKGROUND & AIMS: Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is thought to develop from\
        \ asymptomatic Barrett's esophagus (BE) with a low annual rate of conversion.\
        \ Current endoscopy surveillance for BE patients is probably not cost-effective.\
        \ Previously, we discovered serum glycoprotein biomarker candidates which\
        \ could discriminate BE patients from EAC. Here, we aimed to validate candidate\
        \ serum glycoprotein biomarkers in independent cohorts, and to develop a biomarker\
        \ panel for BE surveillance. METHODS: Serum glycoprotein biomarker candidates\
        \ were measured in 301 serum samples collected from Australia (4 states) and\
        \ USA (1 clinic) using lectin magnetic bead array (LeMBA) coupled multiple\
        \ reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (MRM-MS). The area under receiver\
        \ operating characteristic curve was calculated as a measure of discrimination,\
        \ and multivariate recursive partitioning was used to formulate a multi-marker\
        \ panel for BE surveillance. RESULTS: Different glycoforms of complement C9\
        \ (C9), gelsolin (GSN), serum paraoxonase/arylesterase 1 (PON1) and serum\
        \ paraoxonase/lactonase 3 (PON3) were validated as diagnostic glycoprotein\
        \ biomarker candidates for EAC across both cohorts. A panel of 10 serum glycoproteins\
        \ accurately discriminated BE patients not requiring intervention [BE+/- low\
        \ grade dysplasia] from those requiring intervention [BE with high grade dysplasia\
        \ (BE-HGD) or EAC]. Tissue expression of C9 was found to be induced in BE,\
        \ dysplastic BE and EAC. In longitudinal samples from subjects that have progressed\
        \ towards EAC, levels of serum C9 glycoforms were increased with disease progression.\
        \ CONCLUSIONS: Further prospective clinical validation of the confirmed biomarker\
        \ candidates in a large cohort is warranted. A first-line BE surveillance\
        \ blood test may be developed based on these findings.\n]]></description>\n\

        </link>\n<description><![CDATA[\nNADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (POR)\
        \ is a membrane protein in the endoplasmic reticulum of eukaryotic cells.\
        \ POR is as a key reducing partner for a number of cytochrome P450 proteins\
        \ involved in different metabolic degradation and signaling pathways. Preparation\
        \ of the full-length recombinant POR expressed in bacteria has been reported\
        \ and, typically, involved the use of Triton X-100 detergent for extraction\
        \ of the overexpressed POR from bacterial membranes. However, extraction efficiency\
        \ is always relatively low hindering structural studies, particularly-the\
        \ NMR spectroscopy requiring isotopic enrichment. In this paper, we assessed\
        \ the effect of a variety of detergents and additives on the efficiency of\
        \ the membrane-extraction step in POR preparation protocol. We evaluated non-ionic\
        \ detergents with the variable hydrophobicity (Triton X-100, X-114, and X-405)\
        \ and structure (Triton X-100, TWEEN-20, Brij-35), a zwitterionic/non-ionic\
        \ detergent combination (Triton X-100 and CHAPS), as well as a range of alkylamines\
        \ and polyamines as additives to the conventional extraction buffer containing\
        \ Triton X-100. None of the detergents or detergent-additive combinations\
        \ yielded better extraction efficiency than the conventional protocol with\
        \ the Triton X-100. Lack of variation of the extraction yield allows to hypothesize\
        \ that the conventional protocol extracts all of the available natively-folded\
        \ monomeric POR while the remaining fraction is possibly an unfolded aggregated\
        \ POR, which did not insert in the membranes during expression. We propose\
        \ that the yield of soluble POR may be increased by a careful optimization\
        \ of expression conditions while monitoring the distribution of POR between\
        \ soluble and insoluble fractions in the detergent extraction step.\n]]></description>\n\

        \ to agriculture causing annual yield losses worth more than 100 billion US$.\
        \ Nematode control often involves the use of nematicides, but many of them\
        \ including non-selective fumigants have been phased out, particularly due\
        \ to ecotoxicological concerns. Thus new control strategies are urgently needed.\
        \ Spirotetramat (SPT) is used as phloem-moble systemic insecticide targeting\
        \ acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) of pest insects and mites upon foliar application.\
        \ Our studies revealed that SPT known to be activated in planta to SPT-enol\
        \ acts as a developmental inhibitor of the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis\
        \ elegans and the plant-parasitic nematode Heterodera schachtii. Exposure\
        \ to SPT-enol leads to larval arrest and disruption of the life cycle. Furthermore,\
        \ SPT-enol inhibits nematode ACC activity, affects storage lipids, fatty acid\
        \ composition and disrupts surface coat synthesis. Silencing of H. schachtii\
        \ ACC by RNAi induced similar phenotypes and thus mimics the effects of SPT-enol,\
        \ supporting the conclusion that SPT-enol acts on nematodes by inhibiting\
        \ ACC. Our studies demonstrated that the inhibition of de novo lipid biosynthesis\
        \ by interfering with nematode ACC is a new nematicidal mode of action addressed\

        \ explain how self-replication arises. Specifically, how can self-replicating\
        \ entities develop spontaneously from chemical reaction systems in which no\

        \ (e.g., the citric acid cycle), while some others self-replicate as a whole\
        \ (e.g., the formose reaction); (2) side reactions do not always inhibit such\
        \ systems; (3) many alternative chemical universes often contain one or more\
        \ such systems; (4) it is possible to construct a self-replicating system\
        \ where the entropy of some parts spontaneously decreases, in a manner similar\
        \ to that discussed by Schrodinger; (5) complex self-replicating molecules\

        \ around 30-100 nm in diameter that are secreted from cells and can be found\
        \ in most body fluids. Exosomes can be a vital source of biomarkers as they\
        \ contain various substances (e.g. lipids, RNAs, metabolites and proteins)\
        \ that can reflect the cell of origin (e.g. cancer cells). For isolation of\
        \ exosomes present in biological matrices, ultracentrifugation (UC)-based\
        \ procedures are most common. Other approaches exist, including commercial\
        \ kits developed for easy and low sample volume isolation. In this study,\
        \ differential UC and an isolation kit from a major vendor (Total Exosome\
        \ Isolation Reagent from Thermo Fisher Scientific) were compared. Exosomes\
        \ were isolated from cell culture media of two different cell sources (patient\
        \ derived cells from glioblastoma multiforme and the breast cancer cell line\
        \ MDA-MB-231). For both isolation methods, transmission electron microscopy,\
        \ dynamic light scattering and western blotting indicated the presence of\
        \ exosomes. The kit- and UC isolates contained similar amounts of protein\
        \ measured by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay with absorbance at 562 nm.\
        \ Using western blot, positive exosome markers were identified in all isolates,\
        \ and additional exosome markers were identified using MS-based proteomics.\
        \ For the glioblastoma exosome isolates, the number of proteins identified\
        \ with liquid chromatography tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) was higher for the UC isolates\
        \ than the kit isolates when injecting equal protein amounts, contrary to\
        \ that for the breast cancer exosome isolates. However, negative exosome markers\
        \ were also found in glioblastoma isolates using LC-MS/MS. Thus, we would\
        \ not use the term -exosome isolation- as impurities may be present with both\
        \ isolation methods. Notably, potential biomarkers for both diseases were\
        \ identified in the isolates using LS-MS/MS. In our opinion, the two isolation\
        \ methods had rather similar performance, although with some minor differences\
        \ based on cell of origin.\n]]></description>\n<dc:creator>Bekhradnia, S.</dc:creator>\n\

        \ tyrosine residues in its cytoplasmic tail, which triggers the binding of\
        \ Src Homology 2 (SH2) and Phosphotyrosine Binding (PTB) domains and initiates\
        \ downstream signaling. The sequences flanking the tyrosine residues (referred\
        \ to as phosphosites) must be compatible with phosphorylation by the EGFR\
        \ kinase domain and the recruitment of adapter proteins, while minimizing\
        \ phosphorylation that would reduce the fidelity of signal transmission. In\
        \ order to understand how phosphosite sequences encode these functions within\
        \ a small set of residues, we carried out high-throughput mutational analysis\
        \ of three phosphosite sequences in the EGFR tail. We used bacterial surface-display\
        \ of peptides, coupled with deep sequencing, to monitor phosphorylation efficiency\
        \ and the binding of the SH2 and PTB domains of the adapter proteins Grb2\
        \ and Shc1, respectively. We found that the sequences of phosphosites in the\
        \ EGFR tail are restricted to a subset of the range of sequences that can\
        \ be phosphorylated efficiently by EGFR. Although efficient phosphorylation\
        \ by EGFR can occur with either acidic or large hydrophobic residues at the\
        \ -1 position with respect to the tyrosine, hydrophobic residues are generally\
        \ excluded from this position in tail sequences. The mutational data suggest\
        \ that this restriction results in weaker binding to adapter proteins, but\
        \ also disfavors phosphorylation by the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases c-Src\
        \ and c-Abl. Our results show how EGFR-family phosphosites achieve a trade-off\
        \ between minimizing off-pathway phosphorylation while maintaining the ability\
        \ to recruit the diverse complement of effectors required for downstream pathway\
        \ activation.\n]]></description>\n<dc:creator>Cantor, A. J.</dc:creator>\n\

        Ultrasensitive and selective detection and quantification of dopamine (DA)\
        \ plays a key role in monitoring neurodegenerative diseases. However, the\
        \ detection limit reported for DA detection is typically in the lower nM range.\
        \ Pushing the detection limit to pM or lower for this particular target to\
        \ cover the physiological levels (< 130 pM) is significant. Herein, DA DNA\
        \ aptamer (DAAPT) gold nanoparticle (AuNP) conjugate is utilized to enhance\
        \ the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) signal, which enables to detect and\
        \ quantify DA in the femtomolar (200 fM) to picomolar range. To the best of\
        \ our knowledge, this is the lowest detection limit achieved for SPR sensing\
        \ of dopamine. The as-prepared 10 nm DAAPT-AuNP conjugate demonstrates strong\
        \ binding affinity (Kd = 3.1 nM) to the complementary DNA (cDNA) probe on\
        \ gold chip. The cDNA probe is immobilized to the chip via polydopamine surface\
        \ chemistry, which allows the Michael addition of any primary amine-terminated\
        \ biomolecules. By adjusting the concentration of the DAAPT-AuNP conjugate,\
        \ two calibration curves are generated with dynamic ranges from 100 M to 2\
        \ mM, and from 200 fM to 20 nM, respectively. Both calibration curves have\
        \ negative slopes, showing good agreement to a dose-response curve in an enzyme\
        \ inhibition assay. In addition, the sensing strategy is evaluated to be specific\
        \ for DA detection using a series of DA analogs and other metabolites as potential\
        \ interferences.\n]]></description>\n<dc:creator>Cao, Y.</dc:creator>\n<dc:creator>McDermott,\

        \ to the biosynthesis of lipids, nucleotides and proteins, and production\
        \ of the global methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate\
        \ reductase (MTHFR) represents a key regulatory connection between these cycles,\
        \ generating 5-methyltetrahydrofolate for initiation of the methionine cycle,\
        \ and undergoing allosteric inhibition by its end product SAM. Our 2.5 [A]\
        \ resolution crystal structure of human MTHFR reveals a unique architecture,\
        \ appending the well-conserved catalytic TIM-barrel to a eukaryote-only SAM-binding\
        \ domain. The latter domain of novel fold provides the predominant interface\
        \ for MTHFR homo-dimerization, positioning the N-terminal serine-rich phosphorylation\
        \ region into proximity with the C-terminal SAM-binding domain. This explains\
        \ how MTHFR phosphorylation, identified on 11 N-terminal residues (16-total),\
        \ increases sensitivity to SAM binding and inhibition. Finally, we demonstrate\
        \ the 25-amino-acid inter-domain linker enables conformational plasticity\
        \ and propose it to be a key mediator of SAM regulation.\n]]></description>\n\

        \ include the duplication and diversification of pre-existing folds through\
        \ genetic alterations that include point mutations, insertions, deletions,\
        \ and copy number amplifications, as well as post-translational modifications\
        \ that modify processes such as folding efficiency and cellular localization.\
        \ Following a survey of the human mutation database, we have identified an\
        \ additional mechanism, that we term 'structural capacitance', which results\
        \ in the de novo generation of microstructure in previously disordered regions.\
        \ We suggest that the potential for structural capacitance confers select\
        \ proteins with the capacity to evolve over rapid timescales, facilitating\
        \ saltatory evolution as opoposed to exclusively canonical Darwinian mechanisms.\
        \ Our results implicate the elements of protein microstructure generated by\
        \ this distinct mechanism in the pathogenesis of a wide variety of human diseases.\
        \ The benefits of rapidly furnishing the potential for evolutionary change\
        \ conferred by structural capacitance are consequently counterbalanced by\
        \ this accompanying risk, with the extent of this determined by the host immune\
