        </link>\n<description><![CDATA[\nA widely used experimental design in multisensory\
        \ integration is the McGurk paradigm that entail illusory (cross-modal) perception\
        \ of speech sounds when presented with incongruent audio-visual (AV) stimuli.\
        \ However, the distribution of responses across trials and individuals is\
        \ heterogeneous and not necessarily everyone in a given group of individuals\
        \ perceives the effect. Nonetheless, existing studies in the field primarily\
        \ focus on addressing the correlation between subjective behavior and cortical\
        \ activations to reveal the neuronal mechanisms underlying the perception\
        \ of McGurk effect, typically in the \"frequent perceivers\". Additionally,\
        \ a solely neuroimaging approach does not provide mechanistic explanation\
        \ for the observed inter-trial or inter-individual heterogeneity. In the current\
        \ study we employ high density electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings in a\
        \ group of 25 human subjects that allow us to distinguish \"frequent perceivers\"\
        \ from \"rare perceivers\" using behavioral responses as well as from the\
        \ perspective of large-scale brain functional connectivity (FC). Using global\
        \ coherence as a measure of large-scale FC, we find that alpha band coherence,\
        \ a distinctive feature in frequent perceivers is absent in the rare perceivers.\
        \ Secondly, a decrease in alpha band coherence and increase in gamma band\
        \ coherence occur during illusory perception trials in both frequent and rare\
        \ perceivers. Source analysis followed up with source time series reconstructions\
        \ reveals a large scale network of brain areas involving frontal, temporal\
        \ and parietal areas that are involved in network level processing of cross-modal\
        \ perception. Finally, we demonstrate that how a biophysically realistic computational\
        \ model representing the interaction among key neuronal systems (visual, auditory\
        \ and multisensory cortical regions) can explain the empirical observations.\
        \ Each system involves a group of excitatory and inhibitory Hindmarsh Rose\
        \ neurons that are coupled amongst each other. Large-scale FC between areas\
        \ is conceptualized using coupling functions and the identity of a specific\
        \ system, e.g., visual/ auditory/multisensory is chosen using empirical estimates\
        \ of the time-scale of information processing in these systems. The model\
        \ predicts that the disappearance of alpha band coherence observed in rare\
        \ perceivers stems from a negligible direct A-V (audio-visual) coupling however,\
        \ an increase in indirect interaction via multisensory node leads to enhanced\
        \ gamma band and reduced alpha band coherences observed during illusory perception.\
        \ Overall, we establish the mechanistic basis of large-scale FC patterns underlying\
        \ cross-modal perception.\n]]></description>\n<dc:creator>Kumar, V. G.</dc:creator>\n\

        </link>\n<description><![CDATA[\nIt is widely accepted that holistic processing\
        \ is critical for early face recognition, but recent work has suggested a\
        \ larger role for feature-based processing. The earliest step in familiar\
        \ face recognition is thought to be matching a perceptual representation of\
        \ a familiar face to a stored representation of that face, which is thought\
        \ to be indexed by the N250r event-related potential (ERP). In the current\
        \ face priming studies, we investigated whether this perceptual representation\
        \ can be effectively activated by feature-based processing. In the first experiment,\
        \ prime images were familiar whole faces, isolated eyes, or isolated mouths.\
        \ Whole faces and isolated eyes, but not isolated mouths, effectively modulated\
        \ the N250r. In the second experiment, prime images were familiar whole faces\
        \ presented either upright or inverted. Inverted face primes were no less\
        \ effective than upright face primes in modulating the N250r. Together, the\
        \ results of these studies indicate that activation of the earliest face recognition\
        \ processes is not dependent on holistic processing of a typically configured\
        \ face. Rather, feature-based processing can effectively activate the perceptual\
        \ memory of a familiar face. However, not all features are effective primes\
        \ as we found eyes, but not mouths, were effective in activating early face\
        \ recognition.\n]]></description>\n<dc:creator>Mohr, S.</dc:creator>\n<dc:creator>Wang,\

        </link>\n<description><![CDATA[\nIdentification of protective and/or pathogenic\
        \ genetic modifiers provides important insight into the heterogeneity of disease\
        \ presentations in individuals affected by neuromuscular disorders (NMDs),\
        \ despite having well-defined pathogenic variants. Targeting modifier genes\
        \ to improve disease phenotypes could be especially beneficial in cases where\
        \ the causative genes are large, structurally complex and the mutations are\
        \ heterogeneous. Here, we report a mutation-independent strategy to upregulate\
        \ expression of a compensatory disease-modifying gene in Congenital Muscular\
        \ Dystrophy type 1A (MDC1A) using a CRISPR/dCas9-based transcriptional activation\
        \ system. MDC1A is caused by nonfunctional Laminin 2, which compromises muscle\
        \ fibers stability and axon myelination in peripheral nerves. Transgenic overexpression\
        \ of Lama1, encoding a structurally similar protein Laminin 1, ameliorates\
        \ muscle wasting and paralysis in the MDC1A mouse models, demonstrating its\
        \ role as a protective disease modifier. Yet, upregulation of Lama1 as a postnatal\
        \ gene therapy is hampered by its large size, which exceeds the current genome\
        \ packaging capacity of clinically relevant delivery vehicles such as adeno-associated\
        \ viral vectors (AAVs). In this study, we sought to upregulate Lama1 using\
        \ CRISPR/dCas9-based transcriptional activation system, comprised of catalytically\
        \ inactive S. aureus Cas9 (dCas9) fused to VP64 transactivation domains and\
        \ sgRNAs targeting the Lama1 promoter. We first demonstrated robust upregulation\
        \ of Lama1 in myoblasts, and following AAV9-mediated intramuscular delivery,\
        \ in skeletal muscles of dy2j/dy2j mouse model of MDC1A. We therefore assessed\
        \ whether upregulation of Lama1 would yield therapeutic benefits in dy2j/dy2j\
        \ mice. When the intervention was started early in pre-symptomatic dy2j/dy2j\
        \ mice, Lama1 upregulation prevented muscle fibrosis and hindlimb paralysis.\
        \ An important question for future therapeutic approaches for a variety of\
        \ disorders concerns the therapeutic window and phenotypic reversibility.\
        \ This is particularly true for muscular dystrophies as it has long been hypothesized\
        \ that fibrotic changes in skeletal muscle represent an irreversible disease\
        \ state that would impair any therapeutic intervention at advanced stages\
        \ of the disease. Here, we demonstrate that dystrophic features and disease\
        \ progression were significantly improved and partially reversed when the\
        \ treatment was initiated in symptomatic 3-week old dy2j/dy2j mice with already-apparent\
        \ hind limb paralysis and significant muscle fibrosis. Collectively, our data\
        \ demonstrate the feasibility and therapeutic benefit of CRISPR/dCas9-mediated\
        \ modulation of a disease modifier gene, which opens up an entirely new and\
        \ mutation-independent treatment approach for all MDC1A patients. Moreover,\
        \ this treatment strategy provides evidence that muscle fibrosis can be reversible,\
        \ thus extending the therapeutic window for this disorder. Our data provide\
        \ a proof-of-concept strategy that can be applied to a variety of disease\
        \ modifier genes and a powerful therapeutic approach for various inherited\
        \ and acquired diseases.\n]]></description>\n<dc:creator>Kemaladewi, D.</dc:creator>\n\

        The human mutation rate per generation estimated from trio sequencing has\
        \ revealed an almost linear relationship with the age of the father and the\
        \ age of the mother. The yearly trio-based mutation rate estimate of ~0.43e-9\
        \ is markedly lower than prior indirect estimates of ~1e-9 per year from phylogenetic\
        \ comparisons of the great apes. This suggests either a slowdown over the\
        \ past 10 million years or an inaccurate interpretation of the fossil record.\
        \ Here we use sequencing of chimpanzee, gorilla and orangutan trios and find\
        \ that each species has higher estimated mutation rates per year by factors\
        \ of 1.67+/- 0.22, 1.54+/- 0.2 and 1.84+/- 0.19, respectively. These estimates\
        \ suggest a very recent and appreciable slowdown in human mutation rate, and,\
        \ if extrapolated over the great apes phylogeny, yields divergence estimates\
        \ much more in line with the fossil record and the biogeography.\n]]></description>\n\

        \ includes ascorbic acid, nucleobases and uric acid transporters, with a broad\
        \ evolutionary distribution. In vertebrates, four members have been previously\
        \ recognized, the ascorbate transporters Slc23a1 and Slc3a2, the nucleobase\
        \ transporter Slc23a4 and an orphan transporter SLC23A3. Here we identify\
        \ a fifth member of the vertebrate slc23 complement (slc23a5), expressed in\

        \ such as the lungs or vascular system, is critical for proper physiological\
        \ activity and to prevent disease or malformations. This control incorporates\
        \ the intrinsic physical anisotropy of tubes to generate proportionate organs\
        \ that match their function. The exact mechanisms underlying tube size control\
        \ and how tubular anisotropy is translated at the cellular level are still\
        \ not fully understood. Here we investigate these mechanisms using the Drosophila\
        \ tracheal system. We show that the apical polarity protein Crumbs transiently\
        \ accumulates anisotropically at longitudinal cell junctions during tube elongation.\
        \ We provide evidence indicating that the accumulation of Crumbs in specific\
        \ apical domains correlates with apical surface growth. Hence, we propose\
        \ that the anisotropic accumulation of Crb at the cellular level promotes\
        \ a bias towards longitudinal membrane growth, orienting cell elongation and,\
        \ as a consequence, longitudinal growth at the tissue level. We find that\
        \ Src42A promotes Crb anisotropic accumulation, thereby identifying the first\
        \ polarised cell behaviour downstream of Src42A. Our results indicate that\
        \ Src42A activity favours a higher turnover of Crb protein at longitudinal\
        \ junctions, possibly through a mechanism regulating protein trafficking and/or\
        \ recycling. We propose a model where Src42A would sense the inherent anisotropic\
        \ mechanical tension of the tube and translate it into a polarised Crumbs-mediated\
        \ membrane growth, orienting longitudinal tube growth. This work provides\
        \ new insights into the key question of how organ growth is controlled and\
        \ polarised and unveils the function of two conserved proteins, Crumbs and\

        \ advantage and a problem. Their high surface-area-to-volume ratio enables\
        \ novel medical, industrial, and commercial applications. However, their small\
        \ size also allows them to evade conventional filtration during water treatment,\
        \ posing health risks to humans, plants, and aquatic life. This project aims\
        \ to remove nanoparticles during wastewater treatment using genetically modified\
        \ Escherichia coli in two ways: 1) binding citrate-capped nanoparticles with\
        \ the membrane protein Proteorhodopsin, and 2) trapping nanoparticles using\
        \ Escherichia coli biofilm produced by overexpressing two regulators: OmpR234\
        \ and CsgD. We demonstrate experimentally that Escherichia coli expressing\
        \ Proteorhodopsin binds to 60 nm citrate-capped silver nanoparticles. We also\
        \ successfully upregulate biofilm production and show that Escherichia coli\
        \ biofilms are able to trap 30 nm gold particles. Finally, both Proteorhodopsin\
        \ and biofilm approaches are able to bind and remove nanoparticles in simulated\

        </link>\n<description><![CDATA[\nINTRODUCTION: Spatial navigation is emerging\
        \ as a critical factor in identifying pre-symptomatic Alzheimer pathophysiology,\
        \ with the impact of sex and APOE status on spatial navigation yet to be established.\
        \ METHODS: We estimate the effects of sex on navigation performance in 27,308\
        \ individuals (50-70 years [benchmark population]) by employing a novel game-based\
        \ approach to cognitive assessment using Sea Hero Quest. The effects of APOE\
        \ genotype and sex on game performance was further examined in a smaller lab-based\
        \ cohort (n = 44). RESULTS: Benchmark data showed an effect of sex on wayfinding\
        \ distance, duration and path integration. Importantly in the lab cohort,\
        \ performance on allocentric wayfinding levels was reduced in {varepsilon}4\
        \ carriers compared to {varepsilon}3 carriers, and effect of sex became negligible\
        \ when APOE status was controlled for. To demonstrate the robustness of this\
        \ effect and to ensure the quality of data obtained through unmonitored at-home\
        \ use of the Sea Hero Quest game, post-hoc analysis was carried out to compare\
        \ performance by the benchmark population to the monitored lab-cohort. DISCUSSION:\
        \ APOE {varepsilon}4 midlife carriers exhibit changes in navigation pattern\
        \ before any symptom onset. This supports the move towards spatial navigation\
        \ as an early cognitive marker and demonstrates for the first time how the\
        \ utility of large-scale digital cognitive assessment may hold future promise\
        \ for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease. Finally, benchmark findings\
        \ suggest that gender differences may need to be considered when determining\
        \ the classification criteria for spatial navigational deficits in midlife\
        \ adults.\n]]></description>\n<dc:creator>Coughlan, G.</dc:creator>\n<dc:creator>Coutrot,\

        \ tend to have larger brains. Twin studies suggest the same genetic factors\
        \ influence both brain size and intelligence. This has led to the hypothesis\
        \ that genetics influence intelligence partly by contributing to development\
        \ of larger brains. We tested this hypothesis with molecular genetic data\
        \ using discoveries from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of educational\
        \ attainment, a correlate of intelligence. We analyzed genetic, brain imaging,\
        \ and cognitive test data from the UK Biobank, the Dunedin Study, the Brain\
        \ Genomics Superstruct Project (GSP), and the Duke Neurogenetics Study (DNS)\
        \ (combined N=8,271). We measured genetics using polygenic scores based on\
        \ published GWAS. We conducted meta-analysis to test associations among participants'\
        \ genetics, total brain volume (i.e., brain size), and cognitive test performance.\
        \ Consistent with previous findings, participants with higher polygenic scores\
        \ achieved higher scores on cognitive tests, as did participants with larger\
        \ brains. Participants with higher polygenic scores also had larger brains.\
        \ We found some evidence that brain size partly mediated associations between\
        \ participants' education polygenic scores and their cognitive test performance.\
        \ Effect-sizes were larger in the population-based UK Biobank and Dunedin\
        \ samples than in the GSP and DNS samples. Sensitivity analysis suggested\
        \ this effect-size difference partly reflected restricted range of cognitive\
        \ performance in the GSP and DNS samples. Recruitment and retention of population-representative\
        \ samples should be a priority for neuroscience research. Findings suggest\
        \ promise for studies integrating GWAS discoveries with brain imaging data\
        \ to understand neurobiology linking genetics with individual differences\

        \ mental health disorders, with psychiatric symptoms that are difficult to\
        \ treat with standard psychotropic medications. This study tests the hypothesis\
        \ that psychiatric populations are enriched for pathogenic variants associated\
        \ with selected treatable genetic disorders. Methods: Using next-generation\
        \ sequencing, 2046 psychiatric patients were screened for variants in genes\
        \ associated with four inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs), Niemann-Pick disease\
        \ type C (NPC), Wilson disease (WD), homocystinuria (HOM), and acute intermittent\
        \ porphyria (AIP). Results: Among the 2046 cases, carrier rates of 0.83%,\
        \ 0.98%, 0.20%, and 0.24% for NPC, WD, HOM, and AIP were seen respectively.\
        \ An enrichment of known and likely pathogenic variants in the genes associated\
        \ with NPC and AIP was found in the psychiatric cohort, and especially in\
        \ schizophrenia patients. Conclusion: The results of this study support that\
        \ rare genetic disease variants, such as those associated with IEMs, may contribute\
        \ to the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders. IEMs should be considered\
        \ as possible causative factors for psychiatric presentations, especially\

        </link>\n<description><![CDATA[\nCancer is a disease of the genome, but the\
        \ dramatic inter-patient variability in mutation number is poorly understood.\
        \ Tumours of the same type can differ by orders of magnitude in their mutation\
        \ rate. To understand potential drivers and consequences of the underlying\
        \ heterogeneity in mutation rate across tumours, we evaluated both local and\
        \ global measures of mutation density: both single-stranded and double-stranded\
        \ DNA breaks in 2,460 tumours of 38 cancer types. We find that SCNAs in thousands\
        \ of genes are associated with elevated rates of point-mutations, while similarly\
        \ point-mutation patterns in dozens of genes are associated with specific\
        \ patterns of DNA double-stranded breaks. These candidate drivers of mutation\
        \ density are enriched for known cancer drivers, and preferentially occur\
        \ early in tumour evolution, appearing clonally in all cells of a tumour.\
        \ To supplement this understanding of global mutation density, we developed\
        \ and validated a tool called SeqKat to identify localized 'rainstorms' of\
        \ point-mutations (kataegis). We show that rates of kataegis differ by four\
        \ orders of magnitude across tumour types, with malignant lymphomas showing\
        \ the highest. Tumours with TP53 mutations were 2.6-times more likely to harbour\
        \ a kataegic event than those without, and 239 SCNAs were associated with\
        \ elevated rates of kataegis, including loss of the tumour-suppressor CDKN2A.\
        \ We identify novel subtypes of kataegic events not associated with aberrant\
        \ APOBEC activity, and find that these are localized to specific cellular\
        \ regions, enriched for MYC-target genes. Kataegic events were associated\
        \ with patient survival in some, but not all tumour types, highlighting a\
        \ combination of global and tumour-type specific effects. Taken together,\
        \ we reveal a landscape of genes driving localized and tumour-specific hyper-mutation,\
        \ and reveal novel mutational processes at play in specific tumour types.\n\

        Background: Electric neurostimulation is being developed as an alternative\
        \ treatment for drug-resistant epilepsy patients. A major challenge is to\
        \ identify, among all possible combinations of stimulation parameters, the\
        \ most effective stimulation protocol to achieve seizure control for each\
        \ patient. Objective: To estimate the value of interictal intracranial EEG\
        \ recordings in identifying the most effective stimulation protocol in order\
        \ to decrease number of seizures during intracranial subacute cortical stimulation\
        \ (SCS). Methods: Five patients undergoing SCS were included in this retrospective\
        \ study. Bivariate correlation measures were applied to baseline interictal\
        \ intracranial EEG recordings to infer functional correlation networks. The\
        \ node strength of these networks was calculated for each recording electrode\
        \ (indicating the overall correlation between activity from one electrode\
        \ with the activity from all other electrodes). The relationship between node\
        \ strength and the change in seizure rate associated with SCS was studied\
        \ for the electrodes used for stimulation. Results: Across all five patients,\
        \ node strength was negatively correlated with seizure rate ratio (ratio of\
        \ seizure rate during SCS relative to during baseline) for all frequency bands\
        \ tested (delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma, and high gamma), and both the\
        \ common reference and the common average montage. Conclusion: Interictal\
        \ functional correlation networks contain information that correlates with\
        \ the effect of SCS on the rate of epileptic seizures, suggesting that stimulation\
        \ of those regions with higher node strength (derived from correlation networks)\
        \ is more effective in reducing number of seizures.\n]]></description>\n<dc:creator>Wang,\

        Learning the spatial organization of the environment is essential for most\
        \ animals' survival. This often requires the animal to derive allocentric\
        \ information about the environment from egocentric sensory and motor experience.\
        \ The neural circuits and mechanisms underlying this transformation are currently\
        \ unknown. We addressed this problem in electric fish, which can precisely\
        \ navigate in complete darkness and whose requisite brain circuitry is relatively\
        \ simple. We conducted the first neural recordings in the preglomerular complex,\
        \ the thalamic region exclusively connecting the optic tectum with the spatial\
        \ learning circuits in the dorsolateral pallium. While tectal egocentric information\
        \ was eliminated in preglomerular neurons, the time-intervals between object\
        \ encounters were precisely encoded. We show that this highly-reliable temporal\
        \ information, combined with a speed signal, can permit accurate path-integration\
        \ that then enables computing allocentric spatial relations. Our results suggest\
        \ that similar mechanisms are involved in spatial learning via sequential\
        \ encounters in all vertebrates.\n]]></description>\n<dc:creator>Wallach,\

        \ attention preferentially, a principle termed value-modulated attention capture\
        \ (VMAC). The mechanisms that govern the allocation of attention resources\
        \ can be productively described with a terminology that is more often applied\
        \ to the control of overt behaviours, namely, the distinction between instrumental\
        \ and Pavlovian control, and between model-free and model-based control. While\
        \ instrumental control of VMAC can be either model-free or model-based, it\
        \ is not known whether Pavlovian control of VMAC can be model-based. To decide\
        \ whether this is possible we measured Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials\
        \ (SSVEPs) while 20 healthy adults took part in a novel task. During the learning\
        \ stage participants underwent aversive threat conditioning with two CSs,\
        \ one that predicted pain (CS+) and one that predicted safety (CS-). Instructions\
        \ given prior to the test stage in the task allowed participants to infer\
        \ whether novel, ambiguous CSs (new CS+/ new CS-) were threatening or safe.\
        \ Correct inference required combining stored internal representations and\
        \ new propositional information, the hallmark of model-based control. SSVEP\
        \ amplitudes quantified the amount of attention allocated to novel CSs on\
        \ their very first presentation, before they were ever reinforced. We found\
        \ that SSVEPs were higher for new CS+ than new CS-. Because task design precluded\
        \ model-free or instrumental control this result demonstrates a model-based\
        \ Pavlovian control of VMAC. It confirms, in the domain of internal resource\
        \ allocation, the model-based Pavlovian control of incentive behaviour and\
        \ underlines the potential transformative role of information as an emotion\
        \ regulation technique.\n]]></description>\n<dc:creator>Talmi, D.</dc:creator>\n\

        \ skill to be cultivated through practice, untrained individuals can also\
        \ vary widely in dispositional mindfulness. Prior research has identified\
        \ static neural connectivity correlates of this trait. Here, we use dynamic\
        \ functional connectivity (DFC) analysis of resting-state fMRI to study time-varying\
        \ connectivity patterns associated with naturally varying and objectively\
        \ measured trait mindfulness. Participants were selected from the top and\
        \ bottom tertiles of performers on a breath-counting task to form high trait\
        \ mindfulness (HTM; N = 21) and low trait mindfulness (LTM; N = 18) groups.\
        \ DFC analysis of resting state fMRI data revealed that the HTM group spent\
        \ significantly more time in a brain state associated with task-readiness\
        \ - a state characterized by high within-network connectivity and greater\
        \ anti-correlations between task-positive networks and the default-mode network\
        \ (DMN). The HTM group transitioned between brain states more frequently,\
        \ but the dwell time in each episode of the task-ready state was equivalent\
        \ between groups. These results persisted even after controlling for vigilance.\
        \ Across individuals, certain connectivity metrics were weakly correlated\
        \ with self-reported mindfulness as measured by the Five Facet Mindfulness\
        \ Questionnaire, though these did not survive multiple comparisons correction.\
        \ In the static connectivity maps, HTM individuals had greater within-network\
        \ connectivity in the DMN and the salience network, and greater anti-correlations\
        \ between the DMN and task-positive networks. In sum, DFC features robustly\

        Background The polygenic risk score (PRS) for schizophrenia, derived from\
        \ very large numbers of weakly associated genetic markers, has been repeatedly\
        \ shown to be robustly associated with schizophrenia in independent samples\
        \ and also with other diseases and traits. Aims To explore the distribution\
        \ of the schizophrenia PRS in subjects of different ancestry. Method The schizophrenia\
        \ PRS derived from the large genome-wide association study carried out by\
        \ the Psychiatric Genetics Consortium was calculated using the downloaded\
        \ genotypes of HapMap subjects from eleven different ancestral groups. It\
        \ was also calculated using downloaded genotypes of European schizophrenia\
        \ cases and controls from the CommonMind Consortium. Results The PRS for schizophrenia\
        \ varied significantly between ancestral groups (p < 2*10-16) and was much\
        \ higher in African than European HapMap subjects. The mean difference between\
        \ these groups was ten times as high as the mean difference between European\
        \ schizophrenia cases and controls. The distributions of scores for African\
        \ and European subjects hardly overlapped. Conclusions The PRS cannot be regarded\
        \ as simply a measure of the polygenic contribution to risk of schizophrenia\
        \ and clearly contains a strong ancestry component. It is possible that this\
        \ could be controlled for to some extent by incorporating principal components\
        \ as covariates but doubts remain as to how it should be interpreted. The\
        \ PRS derived from European subjects cannot be applied to non-Europeans, limiting\
        \ its potential usefulness and raising issues of inequity. Previous studies\
        \ which have used the PRS should be re-examined in the light of these findings.\n\

        </link>\n<description><![CDATA[\nMultiple sclerosis is a common, complex neurological\
        \ disease, where almost 20% of risk heritability can be attributed to common\
        \ genetic variants, including >230 identified by genome-wide association studies\
        \ (Patsopoulos et al., 2017). Multiple strands of evidence suggest that the\
        \ majority of the remaining heritability is also due to the additive effects\
        \ of individual variants, rather than epistatic interactions between these\
        \ variants, or mutations exclusive to individual families. Here, we show in\
        \ 68,379 cases and controls that as much as 5% of this heritability is explained\

        \ a key role for regulatory T cell homeostasis and regulation, IFN{gamma}\
        \ biology and NF{kappa}B signaling in MS pathogenesis. As low-frequency variants\
        \ do not show substantial linkage disequilibrium with other variants, and\
        \ as coding variants are more interpretable and experimentally tractable than\

        </link>\n<description><![CDATA[\nSince at first sight aging seems to be omnipresent,\
        \ many authors to this very day regard it as an inevitable consequence of\
        \ the laws of physics. However, studies published in the past two decades\
        \ have conclusively shown that a number of organisms do not age, or at least\
        \ do not age on a scale comparable with other aging organisms. This disparity\
        \ leads us to question why aging evolved in some organisms and not in others.\
        \ We thus present a mathematical model which simulates evolution in a sexually\
        \ reproducing population composed of aging and non-aging individuals. We have\
        \ observed that aging individuals may outcompete non-aging individuals if\
        \ they have a higher starting fertility or if the main mating pattern in the\
        \ population is assortative mating. Furthermore, stronger pathogen pressure\
        \ was found to help the aging phenotype when compared to the non-aging phenotype.\
        \ Last but not least, the aging phenotype was found to more easily outcompete\
        \ the non-aging one or to resist the dominance of the latter for a longer\
        \ period of time in populations composed of dimorphic sexually reproducing\
        \ individuals compared to populations of hermaphrodites. Our findings are\
        \ consistent with both classical evolutionary theories of aging and with evolutionary\
        \ theories of aging which assume the existence of an aging program. They can\
        \ thus potentially work as a bridge between these two opposing views, suggesting\
        \ that the truth in fact lies somewhere in between.\n]]></description>\n<dc:creator>Lenart,\

        </link>\n<description><![CDATA[\nNegative interspecific mating interactions,\
        \ known as reproductive interference, can hamper species coexistence in a\
        \ local patch and promote niche partitioning or geographical segregation of\
        \ closely related species. Conspecific sperm precedence (CSP), which occurs\
        \ when females that have mated with both conspecific and heterospecific males\
        \ preferentially use conspecific sperm for fertilization, might contribute\
        \ to species coexistence by mitigating the costs of interspecific mating and\
        \ hybridization. We examined whether two closely related species exhibiting\
        \ CSP can coexist in a local environment in the presence of reproductive interference.\
        \ First, using a behaviourally explicit mathematical model, we demonstrated\
        \ that two species characterized by negative mating interactions are unlikely\
        \ to coexist because the costs of reproductive interference, such as loss\
        \ of mating opportunity with conspecific partners, are inevitably incurred\
        \ when individuals of both species are present. Second, we experimentally\
        \ demonstrated differences in mating activity and preference in two Harmonia\
        \ ladybird species known to exhibit CSP. According to the developed mathematical\
        \ model of reproductive interference, these behavioural differences should\
        \ lead to local extinction of H. yedoensis because of reproductive interference\
        \ by H. axyridis. This prediction is consistent with field observations that\
        \ H. axyridis uses various food sources and habitats whereas H. yedoensis\
        \ is confined to a less preferred prey item and a pine tree habitat. Finally,\
        \ by a comparative approach, we showed that niche partitioning or parapatric\
        \ distribution, but not sympatric coexistence in the same habitat, is maintained\
        \ between species with CSP belonging to a wide range of taxa, including vertebrates\
        \ and invertebrates living in aquatic or terrestrial environments. Taken together,\
        \ these results lead us to conclude that reproductive interference generally\
        \ destabilizes local coexistence even in closely related species that exhibit\
        \ CSP.\n]]></description>\n<dc:creator>Iritani, R.</dc:creator>\n<dc:creator>Noriyuki,\

        Termites defend their colonies from disease using an array of social behaviours,\
        \ including allogrooming, cannibalism, and burial. We tested how groups of\
        \ eastern subterranean termites (Reticulitermes flavipes) deploy these behaviours\
        \ when presented with a nestmate at different stages of infection with the\
        \ entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae. As expected, the termites\
        \ groomed pathogen-exposed individuals significantly more than mock-treated\
        \ controls; however, grooming levels were significantly higher after spore\
        \ germination than before. Cannibalism became prevalent only after exposed\
        \ termites became visibly ill, and burial was rarely observed. These results\
        \ demonstrate that termites employ different strategies depending on the stage\
        \ of infection that they encounter. Grooming intensity is linked not only\
        \ to pathogen presence, but also to germination status, and, given the temporal\
        \ correlation between cannibalism and visible signs of illness, the host may\
        \ play a role in triggering its own sacrifice.\n]]></description>\n<dc:creator>Davis,\

        Metabolism plays an essential role in shaping T helper (Th) cell responses\
        \ including the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, however the effects\
        \ on IL-10 have not been investigated. We show that the glucose analogue 2-deoxyglucose\
        \ (2DG) specifically inhibits Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation and accompanying\
        \ IL-10 production. In contrast, 2DG promotes IL-17A production by Th17 cells,\
        \ even in the presence of IL-2 known to limit Th17 differentiation, whilst\
        \ totally abrogating the production of IL-10. Notably, rather than inhibiting\
        \ glycolysis, 2DG acts through the inhibition of glycosylation, which is critical\
        \ for IL-2R surface expression and downstream signaling in both mouse and\
        \ man. Strikingly, IL-2 is essential for IL-10 production by Th17 cells, in\
        \ contrast to its inhibitory effect on the production of IL-17A. Our study\
        \ reveals a previously unappreciated, anti-inflammatory role for IL-2 in Th17\

        \ dimension, called the p factor, can capture a person's liability to mental\
        \ disorder. Relevant to the p hypothesis, recent genetic research has found\

        \ Here, for the first time we compare genetic correlations from different\
        \ methods and examine their support for a genetic p factor. We tested the\
        \ hypothesis of a genetic p factor by using principal component analysis on\
        \ matrices of genetic correlations between major psychiatric disorders estimated\
        \ by three methods - family study, Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis, and\
        \ Linkage-Disequilibrium Score Regression - and on a matrix of polygenic score\
        \ correlations constructed for each individual in a UK-representative sample\
        \ of 7,026 unrelated individuals. All disorders loaded on a first unrotated\
        \ principal component, which accounted for 57%, 43%, 34% and 19% of the variance\
        \ respectively for each method. Our results showed that all four methods provided\

        </link>\n<description><![CDATA[\nTranscription is common at active mammalian\
        \ enhancers sometimes giving rise to stable and unidirectionally transcribed\
        \ enhancer-associated long intergenic noncoding RNAs (elincRNAs). ElincRNA\
        \ expression is associated with changes in neighboring gene product abundance\
        \ and local chromosome topology, suggesting that transcription at these loci\
        \ contributes to gene expression regulation in cis. Despite the lack of evidence\
        \ supporting sequence-dependent functions for most elincRNAs, splicing of\
        \ these transcripts is unexpectedly common. Whether elincRNA splicing is a\
        \ mere consequence of their cognate enhancer activity or if it directly impacts\
        \ enhancer-associated cis-regulation remains unanswered. Here we show that\
        \ elincRNAs are efficiently and rapidly spliced and that their processing\
        \ rate is strongly associated with their cognate enhancer activity. This association\
        \ is supported by: their enrichment in enhancer-specific chromatin signatures;\
        \ elevated binding of co-transcriptional regulators, including CBP and p300;\
        \ increased local intra-chromosomal DNA contacts; and strengthened cis-regulation\
        \ on target gene expression. Using nucleotide polymorphisms at human elincRNA\
        \ splice sites, we found that elincRNA splicing enhances their transcription\
        \ and directly impacts cis-regulatory function of their cognate enhancers.\
        \ Importantly, up to 90% of human elincRNAs have nucleotide variants that\
        \ are associated with both their splicing and the expression levels of their\
        \ proximal genes. Our results highlight the unexpected contribution of elincRNA\
        \ splicing to enhancer function.\n]]></description>\n<dc:creator>Tan, J. Y.</dc:creator>\n\

        \ of allele counts, is an important summary statistic in evolutionary biology,\
        \ and is often used to infer the history of population size changes, migrations,\
        \ and other demographic events affecting a set of populations. The expected\
        \ multipopulation SFS under a given demographic model can be efficiently computed\
        \ when the populations in the model are related by a tree, scaling to hundreds\
        \ of populations. Admixture, back-migration, and introgression are common\
        \ natural processes that violate the assumption of a tree-like population\
        \ history, however, and until now the expected SFS could be computed for only\
        \ a handful of populations when the demographic history is not a tree. In\
        \ this article, we present a new method for efficiently computing the expected\
        \ SFS and linear functionals of it, for demographies described by general\
        \ directed acyclic graphs. This method can scale to more populations than\
        \ previously possible for complex demographic histories including admixture.\
        \ We apply our method to an 8-population SFS to estimate the timing and strength\
        \ of a proposed \"basal Eurasian\" admixture event in human history. We implement\
        \ and release our method in a new open-source software package momi2.\n]]></description>\n\

        \ selection under the changing natural environments to survive as diverse\
        \ life forms. All life processes including normal homeostatic development\
        \ and growth into organismic bodies with distinct cellular identifications,\
        \ as well as their adaptive responses to various intracellular and environmental\
        \ stresses, are tightly controlled by signaling of transcriptional networks\
        \ towards regulation of cognate genes by many different transcription factors.\
        \ Amongst them, one of the most conserved is the basic-region leucine zipper\
        \ (bZIP) family. They play vital roles essential for cell proliferation, differentiation\
        \ and maintenance in complex multicellular organisms. Notably, an unresolved\
        \ divergence on the evolution of bZIP proteins is addressed here. By a combination\
        \ of bioinformatics with genomics and molecular biology, we have demonstrated\
        \ that two of the most ancestral family members classified into BATF and Jun\
        \ subgroups are originated from viruses, albeit expansion and diversification\
