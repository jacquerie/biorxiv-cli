        \ many challenges, such as monitoring the movement of pathogens; expanding\
        \ health surveillance beyond humans; collecting data and extracting information\
        \ to identify and predict risks; integrating specialists from different areas\
        \ to handle data, species and distinct social and environmental contexts;\
        \ and, the commitment to bringing relevant information to society. In Brazil,\
        \ there is still the difficulty of building a mechanism that is not impaired\
        \ by its large territorial extension and its poorly integrated sectoral policies.\
        \ The Brazilian Wildlife Health Information System, SISS-Geo, is a platform\
        \ for collaborative monitoring that intends to overcome the challenges in\
        \ wildlife health. It aims integration and participation of various segments\
        \ of society, encompassing: the registration of occurrences by citizen scientists;\
        \ the reliable diagnosis of pathogens from the laboratory and expert networks;\
        \ and computational and mathematical challenges in analytical and predictive\
        \ systems, knowledge extraction, data integration and visualization, and geographic\
        \ information systems. It has been successfully applied to support decision-making\
        \ on recent wildlife health events, such as a Yellow Fever epizooty.\n]]></description>\n\

        </link>\n<description><![CDATA[\nIt has recently been proposed that a single\
        \ dimension, called the p factor, can capture a person's liability to mental\
        \ disorder. Relevant to the p hypothesis, recent genetic research has found\
        \ surprisingly high genetic correlations between pairs of psychiatric disorders.\
        \ Here, for the first time we compare genetic correlations from different\
        \ methods and examine their support for a genetic p factor. We tested the\
        \ hypothesis of a genetic p factor by using principal component analysis on\
        \ matrices of genetic correlations between major psychiatric disorders estimated\
        \ by three methods - family study, Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis, and\
        \ Linkage-Disequilibrium Score Regression - and on a matrix of polygenic score\
        \ correlations constructed for each individual in a UK-representative sample\
        \ of 7,026 unrelated individuals. All disorders loaded on a first unrotated\
        \ principal component, which accounted for 57%, 43%, 34% and 19% of the variance\
        \ respectively for each method. Our results showed that all four methods provided\
        \ strong support for a genetic p factor that represents the pinnacle of the\
        \ hierarchical genetic architecture of psychopathology.\n]]></description>\n\

        </link>\n<description><![CDATA[\nTranscription is common at active mammalian\
        \ enhancers sometimes giving rise to stable and unidirectionally transcribed\
        \ enhancer-associated long intergenic noncoding RNAs (elincRNAs). ElincRNA\
        \ expression is associated with changes in neighboring gene product abundance\
        \ and local chromosome topology, suggesting that transcription at these loci\
        \ contributes to gene expression regulation in cis. Despite the lack of evidence\
        \ supporting sequence-dependent functions for most elincRNAs, splicing of\
        \ these transcripts is unexpectedly common. Whether elincRNA splicing is a\
        \ mere consequence of their cognate enhancer activity or if it directly impacts\
        \ enhancer-associated cis-regulation remains unanswered. Here we show that\
        \ elincRNAs are efficiently and rapidly spliced and that their processing\
        \ rate is strongly associated with their cognate enhancer activity. This association\
        \ is supported by: their enrichment in enhancer-specific chromatin signatures;\
        \ elevated binding of co-transcriptional regulators, including CBP and p300;\
        \ increased local intra-chromosomal DNA contacts; and strengthened cis-regulation\
        \ on target gene expression. Using nucleotide polymorphisms at human elincRNA\
        \ splice sites, we found that elincRNA splicing enhances their transcription\
        \ and directly impacts cis-regulatory function of their cognate enhancers.\
        \ Importantly, up to 90% of human elincRNAs have nucleotide variants that\
        \ are associated with both their splicing and the expression levels of their\
        \ proximal genes. Our results highlight the unexpected contribution of elincRNA\
        \ splicing to enhancer function.\n]]></description>\n<dc:creator>Tan, J. Y.</dc:creator>\n\

        <description><![CDATA[\nSingular olfactory receptor (OR) gene expression coincides\
        \ with the formation of a multi-chromosomal enhancer hub that associates with\
        \ the only transcribed OR allele in each cell. This hub consists of converging\
        \ transcriptional enhancers, or Greek Islands, defined by stereotypic binding\
        \ of Lhx2 and Ebf on a shared, composite DNA motif. How this multi-chromosomal\
        \ hub, or any other genomic compartment, assembles is unknown, and so is the\
        \ significance of compartmentalization in transcription. Here, we report that\
        \ LIM domain binding protein 1 (Ldb1), which is recruited by Lhx2 and Ebf\
        \ to Greek Islands, promotes robust and specific trans interactions between\
        \ these enhancers. In addition to disrupting Greek Island hubs, Ldb1 deletion\
        \ also causes significant downregulation of OR transcription. Thus, our data\
        \ provide insight to the formation of genomic compartments, confirm the essential\
        \ role of interchromosomal interactions in OR gene choice, and establish trans\
        \ enhancement as a mechanism for mammalian gene activation.\n]]></description>\n\

        </link>\n<description><![CDATA[\nMost DNA in the genomes of higher organisms\
        \ does not encode proteins, but is transcribed by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII)\
        \ into long non-coding RNA (lncRNA). The biological significance of most lncRNA\
        \ is largely unclear. Here, we identify a lncRNA (SVALKA) in a cold-sensitive\
        \ region of the Arabidopsis genome. Mutations in SVALKA affect the timing\
        \ of maximal CBF1 expression and freezing tolerance. RNAPII read-through transcription\
        \ of SVALKA results in a cryptic lncRNA overlapping CBF1 on the antisense\
        \ strand, termed asCBF1. asCBF1 transcription is anti-correlated with CBF1\
        \ expression. Our molecular dissection reveals that CBF1 is suppressed by\
        \ RNAPII collision stemming from the SVALKA-asCBF1 lncRNA cascade. The SVK-asCBF1\
        \ cascade provides a mechanism to tightly control CBF1 expression and timing\
        \ that could be exploited to maximize freezing tolerance with mitigated fitness\
        \ costs. Inversion of the transcriptional direction of a lncRNA cascade relative\
        \ to the genes in a co-regulated cluster provides an elegant inbuilt negative\
        \ feedback for cluster expression. Our results provide a compelling example\
        \ of local gene regulation by lncRNA transcription having a profound impact\
        \ on the ability of plants to appropriately acclimate to suboptimal environmental\
        \ conditions.\n]]></description>\n<dc:creator>Kindgren, P.</dc:creator>\n\

        \ variation within, and mobility of, specific transposable elements (TEs),\
        \ such as transposons carrying antibiotic resistance genes. TETyper takes\
        \ short-read whole-genome sequencing data as input and identifies single-nucleotide\
        \ mutations and deletions within the TE of interest, to enable tracking of\
        \ specific sequence variants, as well as the surrounding genetic context(s),\
        \ to enable identification of transposition events. To investigate global\
        \ dissemination of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) and its associated\
        \ transposon Tn4401, we applied TETyper to a collection of >3000 publicly\
        \ available Illumina datasets containing blaKPC. This revealed surprising\
        \ diversity, with >200 distinct flanking genetic contexts for Tn4401, indicating\
        \ high levels of transposition. Integration of sample metadata revealed insights\
        \ into associations between geographic locations, host species, Tn4401 sequence\
        \ variants and flanking genetic contexts. To demonstrate the ability of TETyper\
        \ to cope with high copy number TEs and to track specific short-term evolutionary\
        \ changes, we also applied it to the insertion sequence IS26 within a defined\
        \ K. pneumoniae outbreak. TETyper is implemented in python and is freely available\

        While recent research indicates that human health depends, in part, upon the\
        \ symbiotic relationship between gut microbes and their host, the specific\
        \ interactions between host and microbe that define health are poorly resolved.\
        \ Metagenomic clinical studies clarify this definition by revealing gut microbial\
        \ taxa and functions that stratify healthy and diseased individuals. However,\
        \ the typical single-disease focus of microbiome studies limits insight into\
        \ which microbiome features robustly associate with health, indicate general\
        \ deviations from health, or predict specific diseases. Additionally, the\
        \ focus on taxonomy may limit our understanding of how the microbiome relates\
        \ to health given observations that different taxonomic members can fulfill\
        \ similar functional roles. To improve our understanding of the association\
        \ between the gut microbiome and health, we integrated about 2,000 gut metagenomes\
        \ obtained from eight clinical studies in a statistical meta-analysis. We\
        \ identify characteristics of the gut microbiome that associate generally\
        \ with disease, including functional alpha-diversity, beta-diversity, and\
        \ beta-dispersion. Moreover, we resolve microbiome modules that stratify diseased\
        \ individuals from controls in a manner independent of study-specific effects.\
        \ Many of the differentially abundant functions overlap multiple diseases\
        \ suggesting a role in host health, while others are specific to a single\
        \ disease and may associate with disease-specific etiologies. Our results\
        \ clarify potential microbiome-mediated mechanisms of disease and reveal features\
        \ of the microbiome that may be useful for the development of microbiome-based\
        \ diagnostics. Ultimately, our study clarifies the definition of a healthy\
        \ microbiome and how perturbations to it associate with disease.\n]]></description>\n\

        \ eggs result in high survival of progeny. Previous research has shed light\

        \ quality. We performed transcriptome analysis on zebrafish fertilized eggs\

        \ portrait of the egg transcriptome to determine its association with developmental\
        \ competence and to identify new candidate maternal-effect genes. Fifteen\

        </link>\n<description><![CDATA[\nMotivation: Viruses populate their hosts\
        \ as a viral quasispecies: a collection of genetically related mutant strains.\
        \ Viral quasispecies assembly refers to reconstructing the strain-specific\
        \ haplotypes from read data, and predicting their relative abundances within\
        \ the mix of strains, an important step for various treatment-related reasons.\
        \ Reference-genome-independent (\"de novo\") approaches have yielded benefits\
        \ over reference-guided approaches, because reference-induced biases can become\
        \ overwhelming when dealing with divergent strains. While being very accurate,\
        \ extant de novo methods only yield rather short contigs. It remains to reconstruct\
        \ full-length haplotypes together with their abundances from such contigs.\
        \ Method: We first construct a variation graph, a recently popular, suitable\
        \ structure for arranging and integrating several related genomes, from the\
        \ short input contigs, without making use of a reference genome. To obtain\
        \ paths through the variation graph that reflect the original haplotypes,\
        \ we solve a minimization problem that yields a selection of maximal-length\
        \ paths that is optimal in terms of being compatible with the read coverages\
        \ computed for the nodes of the variation graph. We output the resulting selection\
        \ of maximal length paths as the haplotypes, together with their abundances.\
        \ Results: Benchmarking experiments on challenging simulated data sets show\
        \ significant improvements in assembly contiguity compared to the input contigs,\
        \ while preserving low error rates. As a consequence, our method outperforms\
        \ all state-of-the-art viral quasispecies assemblers that aim at the construction\
        \ of full-length haplotypes, in terms of various relevant assembly measures.\

        \ and lekking behaviors in birds-of-paradise have long excited scientists\
        \ and laymen alike. Remarkably, almost nothing is known about the genomics\
        \ underlying this iconic radiation. Currently, there are 41 recognized species\
        \ of birds-of-paradise, most of which live on the islands of New Guinea. In\
        \ this study we sequenced genomes of representatives from all five major clades\
        \ recognized within the birds-of-paradise family (Paradisaeidae). Our aim\
        \ was to characterize genomic changes that may have been important for the\
        \ evolution of the groups extensive phenotypic diversity. Results We sequenced\
        \ three de novo genomes and re-sequenced two additional genomes representing\
        \ all major clades within the birds-of-paradise. We found genes important\
        \ for coloration, morphology and feather development to be under positive\
        \ selection. GO enrichment of positively selected genes on the branch leading\
        \ to the birds-of-paradise shows an enrichment for collagen, glycogen synthesis\
        \ and regulation, eye development and other categories. In the core birds-of-paradise,\
        \ we found GO categories for startle response (response to predators) and\
        \ olfactory receptor activity to be enriched among the gene families expanding\
        \ significantly faster compared to the other birds in our study. Furthermore,\
        \ we found novel families ofretrovirus-like retrotransposons active in all\
        \ three de novo genomes since the early diversification of the birds-of-paradise\
        \ group, which could have potentially played a role in the evolution of this\
        \ fascinating group of birds. Conclusion Here we provide a first glimpse into\
        \ the genomic changes underlying the evolution of birds-of- paradise. Our\
        \ aim was to use comparative genomics to study to what degree the genomic\
        \ landscape of birds-of-paradise deviates from other closely related passerine\
        \ birds. Given the extreme phenotypic diversity in this family, our prediction\
        \ was that genomes should be able to reveal features important for the evolution\
        \ of this amazing radiation. Overall, we found a strong signal for evolution\
        \ on mechanisms important for coloration, morphology, sensory systems, as\
        \ well as genome structure.\n]]></description>\n<dc:creator>Prost, S.</dc:creator>\n\

        \ to the advent of agriculture, and possibly to the spread of Indo-European\
        \ languages. However, little is known so far about the ancient population\

        \ admixed into many modern populations in the region, in particular populations\
        \ speaking Uralic languages today. In addition, we show that ancestors of\

        \ prevalent cause of dementia, complex combinations of the underlying pathologies\
        \ have led to evolved concepts in clinical and neuropathological criteria\
        \ in the past decade. Pathological AD can be decomposed into subsets of individuals\
        \ with significantly different antemortem cognitive decline rates. Using transcriptome\
        \ as a proxy for functional state, we preselected 414 expression profiles\
        \ of clinically and neuropathologically confirmed AD subjects and age matched\
        \ non-demented controls sampled from a large community based neuropathological\
        \ study. By combining brain tissue specific protein interactome with gene\
        \ network, we identify functionally distinct composite clusters of genes which\
        \ reveal extensive changes in expression levels in AD. The average global\
        \ expression for clusters corresponding to synaptic transmission, metabolism,\
        \ cell cycle, survival and immune response were downregulated while the upregulated\
        \ cluster had a large set of uncharacterized pathways and processes that may\
        \ constitute an AD specific phenotypic signature. We identified four master\
        \ regulators across all clusters of differentially expressed genes by enrichment\
        \ analysis including TGIF1 and EGR3. These transcription factors have previously\
        \ not been associated with AD and were validated in brain tissue samples from\
        \ an independent AD cohort. We identify TGIF1, a transcriptional repressor\
        \ as being neuroprotective in AD by activating co-repressors regulating genes\
        \ critical for DNA repair, maintaining homeostasis and arresting cell cycle.\
        \ In addition, we show that loss of EGR3 regulation, mediates synaptic deficits\
        \ by targeting the synaptic vesicle cycle. Collectively, our results highlight\
        \ the utility of integrating protein interactions with gene perturbations\

        Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a large number of genetic\
        \ risk loci for autoimmune diseases. However, the functional variants underlying\
        \ these disease associations remain largely unknown. There is evidence that\
        \ microRNA-mediated regulation may play an important role in this context.\
        \ Therefore, we assessed whether autoimmune disease loci unfold their effects\
        \ via altering microRNA expression in relevant immune cells. To this end,\
        \ we performed microRNA expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses\
        \ across 115 GWAS regions associated with 12 autoimmune diseases using next-generation\
        \ sequencing data of 345 lymphoblastoid cell lines. Statistical analyses included\
        \ the application and extension of a recently proposed framework (joint likelihood\
        \ mapping), to microRNA expression data and microRNA target gene enrichment\
        \ analyses of relevant GWAS data. Overall, only a minority of autoimmune disease\
        \ risk loci may exert their pathophysiologic effects by altering miRNA expression\
        \ based on JLIM. However, detailed functional fine-mapping revealed two independent\
        \ GWAS regions harboring autoimmune disease risk SNPs with significant effects\
        \ on microRNA expression. These relate to SNPs associated with Crohn's disease\
        \ (CD; rs102275) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA; rs968567), which affect the\
        \ expression of miR-1908-5p (p_rs102275=1.44e-20, p_rs968567=2.54e-14). In\
        \ addition, an independent CD risk SNP, rs3853824, was found to alter the\
        \ expression of miR-3614-5p (p=5.70e-7). To support these findings, we demonstrate\
        \ that GWAS signals for RA and CD were enriched in genes predicted to be targeted\
        \ by both miRNAs (all with p<0.05). In summary, our study points towards a\
        \ pathophysiological role of miR-1908-5p and miR-3614-5p in autoimmunity.\n\

        Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSHD) is a common adult muscular dystrophy\
        \ in which the muscles of the face, shoulder blades and upper arms are among\
        \ the most affected. FSHD is the only disease in which \"junk\" DNA was reactivated\
        \ to cause disease, and the only repeat-related disease where less repeats\
        \ cause disease. More than 95% of FSHD cases are associated with copy number\
        \ loss of a 3.3kb tandem repeat (D4Z4 repeat) at the subtelomeric chromosomal\
        \ region 4q35, of which pathogenic allele contains less than 10 repeats and\
        \ has a specific genomic configuration called 4qA. Currently, genetic diagnosis\
        \ of FSHD requires pulsed-field gel electrophoresis followed by Southern blot,\
        \ which is labor-intensive, semi-quantitative and requires long turnaround\
        \ time. Here, we developed a novel approach for genetic diagnosis of FSHD,\
        \ by leveraging Bionano Saphyr single-molecule optical mapping platform. Using\
        \ a bioinformatics pipeline developed for this assay, we found that the method\
        \ gives direct quantitative measures of repeat numbers, can differentiate\
        \ 4q35 and the highly paralogous 10q26 region, can determine the 4qA/4qB allelic\
        \ configuration, and can quantitate levels of post-zygotic mosaicism. We evaluated\
        \ this approach on 5 patients (including two with post-zygotic mosaicism)\
        \ and 2 patients (including one with post-zygotic mosaicism) from two separate\
        \ cohorts, and had complete concordance with Southern blots, but with improved\
        \ quantification of repeat numbers. We concluded that single-molecule optical\
        \ mapping is a viable approach for molecular diagnosis of FSHD and may be\
        \ applied in clinical diagnostic settings once more validations are performed.\n\

        Microbes affect each other's growth in multiple, often elusive ways. The ensuing\
        \ interdependencies form complex networks, believed to influence taxonomic\
        \ composition, as well as community-level functional properties and dynamics.\
        \ Elucidation of these networks is often pursued by measuring pairwise interaction\
        \ in co-culture experiments. However, combinatorial complexity precludes the\
        \ exhaustive experimental analysis of pairwise interactions even for moderately\
        \ sized microbial communities. Here, we use a machine-learning random forest\
        \ approach to address this challenge. In particular, we show how partial knowledge\
        \ of a microbial interaction network, combined with trait-level representations\
        \ of individual microbial species, can provide accurate inference of missing\
        \ edges in the network and putative mechanisms underlying interactions. We\
        \ applied our algorithm to two case studies: an experimentally mapped network\
        \ of interactions between auxotrophic E. coli strains, and a large in silico\
        \ network of metabolic interdependencies between 100 human gut-associated\
        \ bacteria. For this last case, 5% of the network is enough to predict the\
        \ remaining 95% with 80% accuracy, and mechanistic hypotheses produced by\
        \ the algorithm accurately reflect known metabolic exchanges. Our approach,\
        \ broadly applicable to any microbial or other ecological network, can drive\
        \ the discovery of new interactions and new molecular mechanisms, both for\
        \ therapeutic interventions involving natural communities and for the rational\
        \ design of synthetic consortia.\n]]></description>\n<dc:creator>DiMucci,\

        \ within developing embryos. To understand how TFs regulate cell fate it is\
        \ important to identify their genomic binding sites in these populations.\
        \ However, current methods cannot profile TFs genome-wide at or near the single\
        \ cell level. Here we adapt the CUT&RUN method to profile chromatin proteins\
        \ in low cell numbers, mapping TF-DNA interactions in single cells and individual\
        \ pre-implantation embryos for the first time. Using this method, we demonstrate\
        \ that the pluripotency TF NANOG is significantly more dependent on the SWI/SNF\
        \ family ATPase BRG1 for association with its genomic targets in vivo than\
        \ in cultured cells, a finding that could not have been made using traditional\
        \ approaches. Ultra-low input CUT&RUN (uliCUT&RUN) enables interrogation of\
        \ TF binding from low cell numbers, with broad applicability to rare cell\
        \ populations of importance in development or disease.\n]]></description>\n\

        \ as they can produce diverse, but genetically identical, morphs in response\
        \ to environmental stimuli. Here, using whole genome bisulphite sequencing\
        \ and transcriptome sequencing of the green peach aphid (Myzus persicae),\
        \ we present the first detailed analysis of cytosine methylation in an aphid\
        \ and investigate differences in the methylation and transcriptional landscapes\
        \ of male and asexual female morphs. We find that methylation primarily occurs\
        \ in a CG dinucleotide (CpG) context and that exons are highly enriched for\
        \ methylated CpGs, particularly at the 3' end of genes. Methylation is positively\
        \ associated with gene expression, and methylated genes are more stably expressed\
        \ than un-methylated genes. Male and asexual female morphs have distinct methylation\
        \ profiles. Strikingly, these profiles are divergent between the sex chromosome\
        \ and the autosomes; autosomal genes are hypo-methylated in males compared\
        \ to asexual females, whereas genes belonging to the sex chromosome, which\
        \ is haploid in males, are hyper-methylated. Overall, we find correlated changes\
        \ in methylation and gene expression between males and asexual females, and\
        \ this correlation is particularly strong for genes located on the sex chromosome.\
        \ Our results suggest that differential methylation of sex-biased genes plays\
        \ a role in M. persicae sexual differentiation.\n]]></description>\n<dc:creator>Mathers,\

        Optical mapping is a unique system that is capable of producing high-resolution,\
        \ high-throughput genomic map data that gives information about the structure\
        \ of a genome [21]. Recently it has been used for scaffolding contigs and\
        \ assembly validation for large-scale sequencing projects, including the maize\
        \ [32], goat [6], and amborella [4] genomes. However, a major impediment in\
        \ the use of this data is the variety and quantity of errors in the raw optical\
        \ mapping data, which are called Rmaps. The challenges associated with using\
        \ Rmap data are analogous to dealing with insertions and deletions in the\
        \ alignment of long reads. Moreover, they are arguably harder to tackle since\
        \ the data is numerical and susceptible to inaccuracy. We develop cOMet to\
        \ error correct Rmap data, which to the best of our knowledge is the only\
        \ optical mapping error correction method. Our experimental results demonstrate\
        \ that cOMet has high prevision and corrects 82.49% of insertion errors and\
        \ 77.38% of deletion errors in Rmap data generated from the E. coli K-12 reference\
        \ genome. Out of the deletion errors corrected, 98.26% are true errors. Similarly,\
        \ out of the insertion errors corrected, 82.19% are true errors. It also successfully\
        \ scales to large genomes, improving the quality of 78% and 99% of the Rmaps\
        \ in the plum and goat genomes, respectively. Lastly, we show the utility\
        \ of error correction by demonstrating how it improves the assembly of Rmap\
        \ data. Error corrected Rmap data results in an assembly that is more contiguous,\
        \ and covers a larger fraction of the genome.\n]]></description>\n<dc:creator>Mukherjee,\
